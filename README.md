# What is PixelOS?

PixelOS began out the need for our team to deliver pixel streaming in the cloud.

PixelOS comes in two flavours:
- PixelOS Server Edition
- PixelOS Desktop Edition

Both editions are currently based on the source-based Linux distro Gentoo. Gentoo was a natural choice for our team after considering all of the options. In the future we plan to add package management to PixelOS.

This is not a multilib distribution.

PixelOS is a source-based, systemd-based, linux-based, and currently NVIDIA-based.

PixelOS currently features support for the following:
- Custom PixelOS Linux Kernel 5.16.18
- NVIDIA 510 Driver dkms
- Lightly Skinned XFCE4 Windows Manager
- Wine with Proton Patches
- Vulkan DX12 Support
- H.264 Pixel Streaming Support
- Premium Pixel Streaming Support for Unreal Engine 4.27 and Unreal Engine 5
