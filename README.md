# What is PixelOS?

PixelOS began out the need for our team to deliver pixel streaming in the cloud.

PixelOS comes in two flavours:
- PixelOS Server Edition
- PixelOS Desktop Edition

Both editions are currently based on the source-based Linux distro Gentoo. Gentoo was a natural choice for our team after considering all of the options. In the future we plan to add package management to PixelOS.

PixelOS Server Edition features bleeding-edge support for Windows based videogames running headless on a server. What is this voodoo we speak of? Well it is quite simple. In order for the world support cloud based pixel streaming the ability to provide this support requires new extreme innovation regarding deployment of systems used by gamers and non-gamers to experience 3D applications running in the cloud.

This is not a multilib distribution.

PixelOS is a source-based, systemd-based, linux-based.

PixelOS currently features support for the following:
- Custom PixelOS Linux Kernel 5.16.18
- NVIDIA 510 Driver dkms. AMD support to follow shortly
- Lightly Skinned XFCE4 Windows Manager
- Wine with Proton Patches
- Vulkan DX12 Patches
- H.264 Pixel Streaming Patches
- Premium Pixel Streaming Support for Unreal Engine 4.27 and Unreal Engine 5
